    Addons

    An addon contains additional features that are not part of the subscribed plan, but are made available to customers on purchase of the addon. There are two kinds of addons - one-time and recurring. For a one-time addon, customers pay only once at the time of subscription, whereas for a recurring addon, customers have to pay for the addon each time they pay for the planâ€™s subscription. An addon can be associated with one or more plans of a product.
